# RaspberryPI Project
The purpose of this repository is to house the scripts used for collecting data through sensors on a RaspberryPI for an ECE project at NCSU. Complete with RGB lights that change when a target approaches a motion sensor, and a button that allows for file transfers over a TCP socket.
